# Inknit -- not production ready, probably never will be!
**Use at your own risk, this is a tiny little sideproject so little comprehensive testing will be done!**
My latest Rust endeavour is Inknit! It's purpose is to be `npm init` on steroids!

## Usage
Run `inknit` and the user prompts will guide you through the whole process! ;)

## Additional features (in comparison to NPM)
- You can import a repo using npx degit
- You can add additional packages before writing to your package.json
So far, that's it!
